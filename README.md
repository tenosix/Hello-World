# Hello-World
My first repository for getting used to using github
Just stopping by as per helloworld instructions, making an edit and then commiting it.
I just found some keyboard shortcuts by hitting "shift" + ?:
Site wide shortcuts
s or / 	Focus search bar
g n 	Go to Notifications
g d 	Go to Dashboard
? 	Bring up this help dialog
j 	Move selection down
k 	Move selection up
x 	Toggle selection
o or enter 	Open selection
h 	Open hovercard
CTL + b is the bookmarks toolbar, menu and other bookmarks.
